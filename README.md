# Online Food Processing System - Object-Oriented Design

This repository demonstrates the design of an **Online Food Processing System** using **Object-Oriented Design (OOD)** principles. The system design includes **UML diagrams** created in **STAR UML** to illustrate the architecture, relationships, and interactions within the system. This project was implemented during my **2nd year as an undergraduate**, collaboratively with my colleagues, as part of a practical learning experience with OOD methodologies and system modeling.

## Project Overview

The Online Food Processing System is a conceptual model designed to facilitate and optimize the process of online food ordering and delivery. It aims to provide a streamlined experience for:

- **Customers**: Browsing menus, placing orders, and tracking deliveries.
- **Restaurants**: Managing menus and processing customer orders.
- **Delivery Personnel**: Handling order pickups and deliveries efficiently.

The system highlights key design principles such as modularity, reusability, and scalability, making it a robust foundation for real-world applications.

## Repository Contents

The repository contains the following files:

- **`OOAD.pdf`**: 
  - A detailed document with UML diagrams illustrating the system's structure and behavior:
    - **Class Diagrams**: Depict the static structure of the system, including classes, attributes, methods, and relationships.
    - **Sequence Diagrams**: Showcase the dynamic interactions between objects during various processes (e.g., order placement, payment processing).
- **README.md**:
  - Provides an overview of the project, code structure, and guidance for users and contributors.

## System Features and Components

The system is designed with the following key features:

### 1. **User Management**
- Handles registration, login, and profile management for:
  - Customers
  - Restaurants
  - Delivery personnel

### 2. **Menu Management**
- Restaurants can:
  - Add, update, and delete menu items.
  - Manage availability and pricing of dishes.

### 3. **Order Processing**
- Enables customers to:
  - Place and modify orders.
  - Track order status from processing to delivery.

### 4. **Payment System**
- Secure payment handling with support for multiple payment methods.
- Manages transaction records and ensures seamless processing.

### 5. **Delivery Management**
- Assigns delivery tasks to personnel.
- Tracks order delivery status in real-time.

## UML Design

### **Class Diagrams**
- Provide a blueprint of the system's static structure.
- Highlight classes, attributes, methods, and relationships.

### **Sequence Diagrams**
- Detail the dynamic behavior of the system.
- Illustrate object interactions during key processes, such as order placement and payment.
